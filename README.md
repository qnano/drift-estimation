Google colab example (For some reason the CPU multithreading runs very slow on linux though)

Build from source (tested on windows and linux)
-----------------------------------------------
DISCLAIMER: My cmake file was created entirely by trial and error, please let me know if I'm doing something weird.

- On Windows, install cmake and make sure it is available in the path. Then, run build_windows.bat
- On Linux (tested on Ubuntu 20.04):
  - Install CUDA from the nVidia website. Install cmake and use "cmake .", followed by "make" in the repository root. 
  - Currently, CPU-only build is not compiling, you need CUDA.
  - This should build ./bin/release/libdme_cuda.so
  - If anything goes wrong, cmake intermediary files have to be removed before starting over (CMakeFiles directory and CMakeCache.txt)
  - dme_example.py should now run without errors. 
- On MacOS, CUDA is no longer supported by nVidia, so only the CPU version can be used. 
  - Thanks to Duncan Ryan for help getting the GCC build working and confirming it runs on MacOS!

To run dme_example.py using pre-build Windows binaries:
-------------------------------------------------------

1. Install python. Anaconda is recommended: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
2. Create a virtual environment, such as an anaconda environment:

```
conda create -n myenv anaconda python=3.8
conda activate myenv
```

3. Install required pip packages, installing these within the virtual environment:

```
pip install tqdm scipy numpy matplotlib 
```

4.  Run the example code:

```
python dme_example.py
```
